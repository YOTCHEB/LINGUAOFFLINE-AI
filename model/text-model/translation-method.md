# Translation Method (starter)

This document outlines a lightweight pipeline for offline translation.

- Prepare parallel corpus (CSV/JSON).
- Train a small sequence-to-sequence model (e.g., Fairseq, Hugging Face Transformers with distillation).
- Or use a simple phrase-based or retrieval-based baseline for demo.

Include a `sample_translate.py` to demonstrate the flow.
